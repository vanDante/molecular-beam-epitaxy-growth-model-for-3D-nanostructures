INTRODUCTION

This code allows to model the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) of III-N materials on 3D nano- or microstructures.

The model simulates the shell growth on the nano-/microstructure sidefacets as well as the growth on its top facet and the substrate. It is based on a system of coupled one-dimensional(1D) diffusion equations which is solved by a numerical finite difference method (FDM) using the NumPy package for scientific computing with Python. The model is presented in detail in the following publication and complemented in the supplemental information (see links below).
